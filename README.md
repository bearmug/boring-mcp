# Boring MCP

A set of implementations for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), designed to make common workflows so smooth they become boring.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) defines standardized interfaces for Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with their context. This protocol streamlines how LLMs process, interpret, and respond to information, creating a more consistent and predictable experience.

## Implementation Candidates

The following MCP implementations are planned or in development:

| Implementation | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| [**boring-mongo**](./boring-mongo/) | MongoDB MCP for multi-cluster management with simplified aliases, data bridging, and automatic secret renewal. |
| [**boring-postgres**](./boring-postgres/) | PostgreSQL MCP for multi-database management with aliases, schema versioning, and performance monitoring. |
| [**boring-k8s**](./boring-k8s/) | Kubernetes MCP for managing resources across multiple clusters with standardized checks and reporting. |

## Why "Boring"?

The best tools are those that become invisible - so reliable and intuitive that they fade into the background, allowing you to focus on solving real problems. The "boring" in Boring MCP reflects commitment to:

- **Reliability**: Implementations that work consistently every time
- **Simplicity**: Clear, understandable patterns with minimal surprises
- **Standardization**: Common workflows that behave predictably across different environments
- **Productivity**: Removing friction from the development process

## Project Status

⚠️ **Early Development** - This project is in its initial stages. We're actively working on defining core interfaces and implementations.

## Getting Started

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! If you're interested in helping make LLM interactions boring (in the best way possible), please stay tuned for contribution guidelines.
